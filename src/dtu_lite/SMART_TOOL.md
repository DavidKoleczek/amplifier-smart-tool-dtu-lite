Stands up an isolated, realistic environment from a profile on Docker Compose so software can be tested as though actually deployed. Use when passing tests on your machine is not enough evidence and code must run against real dependencies, published local repositories, and rewritten URLs without touching the host.

**The library is the tool.** `dtu_lite.lib` holds every capability. The CLI is a thin
wrapper over it, so anything you can do from the shell you can also do from Python.

## When to reach for it

- Stands up an isolated, realistic environment from a profile on Docker Compose so software can be tested as though actually deployed. Use when passing tests on your machine is not enough evidence and code must run against real dependencies, published local repositories, and rewritten URLs without touching the host.

## Before writing code

Confirm every capability and argument against `dtu-lite <command> --help` before using it.
Do not fill gaps from memory. The library source beside this file, `lib.py`, carries the
signatures. The repository's `docs/01-library.md` and `docs/02-cli.md` carry the rest.

## Install

From a clone of the repository:

```bash
# as a CLI
uv tool install .

# as a library, from another project
uv add /path/to/dtu-lite
```

Verify with `dtu-lite manifest`, which needs no credentials.

## Prerequisites

Deterministic capabilities need only `uv`. Model-backed capabilities run through GitHub
Copilot, signed in as the GitHub CLI's user: `gh` must be installed and `gh auth login`
completed with an account that has a Copilot subscription. Without that, a model-backed
capability fails immediately and names what to configure; it never falls back to a
deterministic answer.

Runs on Linux, macOS, and Windows.

## Straight and smart paths

Deterministic capabilities run with no provider configured. Model-backed capabilities go
through GitHub Copilot, signed in as the GitHub CLI's user, and say so in their help text.

## Output and failure contract

Results go to stdout, diagnostics to stderr. A failure prints a message naming what went
wrong and how to fix it, and exits non-zero: 1 for a failure the tool can name, 2 for a
bad invocation. Never treat an empty result as success.

## Choosing a surface

Import the library from Python. Shell out to the CLI from anything that cannot import
Python in-process: a shell script, a CI job, or an agent that can run commands but not
load a Python object. Both reach the same capabilities.
